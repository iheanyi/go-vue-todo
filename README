# Go Vue Todo

A small example app showing how to build an app with Go, BoltDB, and Vue.js. 

# Getting Started

This project uses `govendor` for vendoring. Make sure you have that installed
per the instruction in its [repo](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).

For running/building the code, you should run `webpack --watch --config frontend/src/build/webpack.dev.conf.js`. Then visit the URL `localhost:1415/todos` and you'll be able to see the application.
